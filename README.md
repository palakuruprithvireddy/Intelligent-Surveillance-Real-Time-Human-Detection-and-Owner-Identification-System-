The Project is designed to perform the following tasks:
1. Human Detection: Accurately identify humans in real-time video streams from sources like 
webcams.
2. Owner Recognition: Match the detected face with a pre-trained dataset of the owner's images to 
verify their identity, even with variations in appearance (e.g., lighting, facial expressions).
3. Alert Generation: Trigger an email alert with a snapshot if an unknown person is detected or the 
owner is not recognized, notifying relevant parties of the situation.
